      <p> Mental health affects everyone regardless of culture, race,ethnicity, gender or sexual orrientation. Mental illnesses are conditions that affect a person’s thinking, feeling, mood or behavior, such as depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, or schizophrenia.</p> 
  <p> 1 in every 5 adults experience mental illness</p> 
   <p>At least 8.4 million people in the U.S. provide care to an adult with a mental or emotional health issue. Caregivers of adults with mental or emotional health issues spend an average of 32 hours per week providing unpaid care</p> 
    <h2>Why is mental health important for overall health?</h2> 
    <p> Mental and physical health are equally important components of overall health.  Mental illness, especially depression, increases the risk for many types of physical health problems, particularly long-lasting conditions like stroke, type 2 diabetes, and heart disease.</p> 
   <h2>Can your mental health change over time?</h2>
   <p> Yes, it’s important to remember that a person’s mental health can change over time, depending on many factors.  When the demands placed on a person exceed their resources and coping abilities, their mental health could be impacted. </p>
